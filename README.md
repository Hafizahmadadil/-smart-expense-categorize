# 💸 Smart Expense Tracker - AI/ML Project

An AI-powered Smart Expense Tracker that helps users categorize their daily spending using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. This project demonstrates how machine learning models can classify expenses based on short text descriptions, helping users gain better financial insights.

---

## 🧠 Project Objective

To create a simple, intelligent expense categorization system using a labeled dataset of spending descriptions and categories, and visualize the results with pie charts.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Google Colab
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* GitHub (for portfolio hosting)

---

## 🧾 About the Dataset

This project uses a **synthetic personal finance dataset** created manually using Python. The dataset mimics real-world personal expense data including categories such as groceries, rent, transport, entertainment, etc. This approach avoids dataset licensing issues and makes the project fully reproducible.
